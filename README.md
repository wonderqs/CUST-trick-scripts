Huang Guoji is a sunshine boy and also a fresh man of CUST(Changchun University of Science and Technology).

Hainanese Chicken Rice is his favourite food, the best way to enjoy it for Huang is mixing it with a cup of Taiwan Grass jelly, tasty? right! But I never think so.

Huang has a rich life in university. Not only palying LOL, but there are also many other hobbies, such as Watching Japanese videos, Listening SNH48's songs... by the way, Ju Jingyi in SNH48 is Huang's dream lover. Although Ju is  perfect to Huang, she is not the only one. Because another girl brushed past Huang and stolen his heart on the way to eating Hainanese Chicken Rice a few days ago.
